We examine the effects of the pension laws of 1907 and 1912, which granted old-age pensions to Union Army veterans. Life expectancy for veterans, who received such a pension, increased by 0.5 years and 2.7 years, respectively. The effect of veteran pensions on longevity was large across wealth groups and size of city. Pensions reduced mortality for both acute and non-acute causes of death\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-29T22:33:30.011130"}, "key": "/books/OL16362428M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL4998871A"}], "publish_places": ["Bonn, Germany"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-09-23T13:25:50.101855"}, "lccn": ["2007618537"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file as viewed on 6/20/2007.\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=2668"], "publish_date": "2007", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL11754431W"}]}
