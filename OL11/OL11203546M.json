As if she didn't already have enough questions about her mother's suicide, Tish is forced to confront one more.  She is renovating a northern Michigan log cabin, one in which she spent her childhood summers.  But what she finds doesn't speak of carefree vacations in the woods:  a torn photo of her mother with the words \"don't ask why\" written across her face.  Combined with mysterious relatives and a backwoods drug ring, this 26-year-old mystery may be more than she can handle.  Tish must put the pieces all together or risk losing everything--including her life.  Book 2 in the Patricia Amble Mystery series, Kill Me If You Can is a suspense-packed story of family secrets, long-distance romance, and the renovation of the heart."}, "physical_format": "Paperback", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2011-04-22T20:54:51.638010"}, "key": "/books/OL11203546M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL2791542A"}], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-30T09:38:13.731961"}, "identifiers": {"librarything": ["4959392"], "goodreads": ["3070895"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780800731588"], "isbn_10": ["0800731581"], "publish_date": "April 1, 2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL8379492W"}]}
