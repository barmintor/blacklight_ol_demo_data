Va., and a conference on theoretical physics, Washington, D.C. (1939-1940).  Subjects include astronomy, composition of the upper atmosphere, cosmic ray flares, geomagnetism, high voltage, conversion of war industries to peacetime uses, magnetism, physics, nuclear physics, seismology, and the Van de Graaff generator.  Includes scientific notebooks (1930-1931) of his wife, Winifred Gray Whitman, who collaborated with Tuve in analyzing the effect of high frequency resonance radiation on animals.\n\nCorrespondents include Vannevar Bush, Sir J.
