Why? Because they know many of these apps are written by programmers with little or no experience or training in software security. Don\u2019t be victimized. Securing PHP Web Applications will help you master the specific techniques, skills, and best practises you need to write rock-solid PHP code and harden the PHP software you\u2019re already using.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDrawing on more than fifteen years of experience in Web development, security, and training, Tricia and William Ballad show how security flaws can find their way into PHP code, and they identify the most common security mistakes made by PHP developers. The authors present practical, specific solutions\u2013techniques that are surprisingly easy to understand and use, no matter what level of PHP programming expertise you have.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecuring PHP Web Applications covers the most important aspects of PHP code security, from error handling and buffer overflows to input validation and filesystem access. The authors explode the myths that discourage PHP programmers from attempting to secure their code and teach you how to instinctively write more secure code without compromising your software\u2019s performance or your own productivity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCoverage includes\r\n\r\n    * Designing secure applications from the very beginning\u2013and plugging holes in applications you can\u2019t rewrite from scratch\r\n    * Defending against session hijacking, fixation, and poisoning attacks that PHP can\u2019t resist on its own\r\n    * Securing the servers your PHP code runs on, including specific guidance for Apache, MySQL, IIS/SQL Server, and more\r\n    * Enforcing strict authentication and making the most of encryption\r\n    * Preventing dangerous cross-site", "physical_format": "Paperback", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2014-07-28T18:16:59.284934"}, "key": "/books/OL22553066M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6475878A"}], "publish_places": ["Upper Saddle River, NJ"], "pagination": "p. cm.", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-11-16T04:11:41.976145"}, "dewey_decimal_class": ["005.8"], "notes": "Includes index.", "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["5755443"], "librarything": ["8439906"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780321534347"], "lccn": ["2008042783"], "isbn_10": ["0321534344"], "publish_date": "2009", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13617981W"}]}
