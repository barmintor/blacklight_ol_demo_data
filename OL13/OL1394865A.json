{"bio": "I'm Brandon Sanderson, and I write stories of the fantastic: fantasy, science fiction, and thrillers.\r\n\r\nMy newest book is Steelheart, set in a near-future Chicago ruled by a ruthless villain with no heroes to oppose him. There is a free 5-chapter preview ebook here on Amazon that you should check out, with a corresponding sampler audiobook on Audible.\r\n\r\nMistborn and The Way of Kings are among my most popular works, as are my concluding volumes to Robert Jordan's epic series The Wheel of Time. My novella The Emperor's Soul won a Hugo Award in 2013. This year also marked the release of my first young adult fantasy, The Rithmatist. In early 2014 I'll be putting out Words of Radiance, the second book in my grand epic The Stormlight Archive.\r\n\r\nSample chapters from all of my books are available at brandonsanderson.com/library -- and check out the rest of my site for chapter-by-chapter annotations, deleted scenes, and more.", "name": "Brandon Sanderson", "links": [{"url": "http://www.brandonsanderson.com/", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Official Author's Website"}, {"url": "http://www.amazon.com/Brandon-Sanderson/e/B001IGFHW6", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Amazon Author Page"}, {"url": "http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Goodreads Author Page"}], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "personal_name": "Brandon Sanderson", "photos": [7252549], "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2014-02-25T06:18:16.079284"}, "latest_revision": 7, "key": "/authors/OL1394865A", "birth_date": "19 December 1975", "type": {"key": "/type/author"}, "revision": 7}
