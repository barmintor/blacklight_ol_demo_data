{"bio": "Alfred Tennyson, 1<sup>st</sup> Baron Tennyson, FRS, much better known as \"Alfred, Lord Tennyson,\" was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria's reign and remains one of the most popular poets in the English language.\r\n\r\nTennyson excelled at penning short lyrics, \"In the valley of Cauteretz\", \"Break, Break, Break\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\" and \"Crossing the Bar\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as Ulysses, although In Memoriam A.H.H. was written to commemorate his best friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and fellow student at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a cerebral hemorrhage before they were married. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, Ulysses, and Tithonus. During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\r\n\r\nTennyson wrote a number of phrases that have become commonplaces of the English language, including: \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\", \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\". He is the second most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations after Shakespeare.<sup>[1][1]</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson", "name": "Alfred, Lord Tennyson", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "death_date": "6 October 1892", "alternate_names": ["Alfred Tennyson", "Alfred Lord Tennyson", "Alfred Tennyson Tennyson", "Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson Baron", "Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson, Baron", "Alfred Tennyson, Baron Tennyson", "Tennyson", "Lord Alfred Tennyson", "Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson Baron.", "Baron Alfred Tennyson Tennyson", "[Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson Baron,]", "Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson baron", "ALFRED TENNYSON", "Lord Tennyson", "Alfred Tennyson", "Lord Alfred, Tennyson", "Tennnyson, Alfred Tennyson Baron", "Tennyson, Alfred Baron", "TENNYSON, Alfred Baron.", "TENNYSON, ALFRED TENNYSON, BARON, 1809-1892.", "Lord Tennyson Alfred"], "photos": [6618758, 6424981, 3367747], "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2013-03-30T15:14:01.432155"}, "latest_revision": 10, "key": "/authors/OL30664A", "birth_date": "6 August 1809", "title": "Baron", "personal_name": "Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson", "type": {"key": "/type/author"}, "revision": 10}
