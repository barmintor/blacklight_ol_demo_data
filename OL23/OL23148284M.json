The definitive Urdu text appeared toward the end of the 19th century, but English translations have been censored and abridged--until now. Here, the adventures of Amir Hamza are captured with all the colorful action, ribaldry, and fantastic elements intact. Amir Hamza travels to exotic lands, defeats many enemies, loves many women, and converts hundreds of infidels to the True Faith of Islam before finding his way back to his first love, the Persian emperor's daughter. Guided by a Merlin-like clairvoyant called Buzurjmehr and accompanied by his loyal friend, the ingenious trickster Amar Ayyar, Amir Hamza rides his winged steed Ashqar into combat against a marvelous array of opponents.--From publisher description."}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2010-08-19T11:49:17.193392"}, "key": "/books/OL23148284M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6601273A"}], "publish_places": ["New York"], "oclc_number": ["191922794"], "pagination": "xviii, 954 p. ;", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:26:43.851466"}, "lccn": ["2009290211"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Epic literature\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nTranslated from Urdu."}, "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["2971701"], "librarything": ["4199841"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780812977431"], "isbn_10": ["0812977432"], "publish_date": "2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13759326W"}]}
