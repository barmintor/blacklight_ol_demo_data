In the first phase of the programme, two demonstration sites were established in Doncaster and Newham with funding to provide increased availability of cognitive-behaviour therapy-based (CBT) services to those in the community who need them. The services opened in late summer 2006. This paper documents the achievements of the sites up to September 2007 (roughly their first year of operation) and makes recommendations for the future roll out of IAPT services."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-29T22:44:04.493184"}, "key": "/books/OL23148621M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6601382A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:20.168090"}, "lccn": ["2009376002"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"November 2008.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0897.pdf"], "publish_date": "2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13759443W"}]}
