When inflation target is observable and credible to the public, markets provide the bank with information about the aggregate state of the economy, and hence the bank can stabilize inflation. However, when inflation target is unobservable or less credible, the public updates their perceived inflation target and the information revealed from markets to the bank becomes less perfect. The degree of uncertainty facing the bank crucially depends on how two-way communication works."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-29T22:07:52.872025"}, "key": "/books/OL23148623M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL1453220A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:23.021825"}, "lccn": ["2009376004"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"November 2008.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0899.pdf"], "publish_date": "2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL5892117W"}]}
