In contrast to neoclassical theories, the results show that even a small difference in the ex-ante productivity distribution between North and South can a have significant impact on the location of firms. Despite differences in aggregate capital to labour ratios, wage and rental rates continue to be the same in both locations. The paper also analyses the effects of risk on industrial locations, and shows why 'low-tech' industries tend to migrate to the South, while 'high-tech' industries continue to locate in the North."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-29T22:44:04.493184"}, "key": "/books/OL23148619M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6500475A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:16.884926"}, "lccn": ["2009376000"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"November 2008.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0895.pdf"], "publish_date": "2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13644292W"}]}
