In this paper, we use detailed U.S. trade statistics to provide a broad overview of how the margins of trade contribute to variation in U.S. imports and exports across trading partners, types of trade (i.e. arm's-length versus related-party) and both short and long time horizons. Among other results, we highlight the differential behaviour of related-party and arm's-length trade in response to  the 1997 Asian financial crisis."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-31T17:46:17.827763"}, "key": "/books/OL23148630M", "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:29.022202"}, "lccn": ["2009376011"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"January 2009.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0906.pdf"], "publish_date": "2009"}
