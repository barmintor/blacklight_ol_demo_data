Millions are drawn every year to the stunning beauty of this rocky landscape of spruce-fir forest and granite islands. Some, like nature writer Christopher Camuto, never stop coming back. In Time and Tide in Acadia the author draws on years of walking Mount Desert\u2019s summits and shorelines, canoeing its marshes, kayaking its tidal waters, and visiting its outer islands. To this task Camuto brings an appetite for observing wildlife and landscape with considerable originality, a regard for history and indigenous perceptions of nature, a keen interest in exploring the psychological and philosophical appeal of nature, and a writer\u2019s love of language. As in his previous, highly praised books, Camuto fulfills his promise to give the reader innumerable vantages on the nature of a remarkable place that it takes time to get to know."}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2011-04-28T09:22:44.769003"}, "key": "/books/OL23147851M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL34030A"}], "publish_places": ["New York"], "pagination": "p. cm.", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:13:56.982427"}, "dewey_decimal_class": ["508.741/45"], "notes": "Includes bibliographical references.", "identifiers": {"librarything": ["8412159"], "goodreads": ["5485612"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780393060676"], "lccn": ["2009001693"], "publish_date": "2009"}
