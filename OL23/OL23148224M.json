Well, consider this: If Facebook were a country, it would have the sixth largest population in the world.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, we no longer live in a world of six degrees of separation. In fact, we're now down to only six pixels of separation, which changes everything we know about doing business.\r\n\r\nThis is the first book to integrate digital marketing, social media, personal branding, and entrepreneurship in a clear, entertaining, and instructive manner that everyone can understand and apply.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of timely case studies and fascinating stories, SIX PIXELS OF SEPARATION offers a complete set of the latest tactics, insights, and tools that will empower you to reach a global audience and consumer base-and, best yet, you can do this pretty much for free. Digital marketing expert Mitch Joel unravels this fascinating world of new media-but does so with a brand-new perspective that is driven by compelling results. The smarter entrepreneurs and top executives are leveraging these digital channels to get their voice \"out there\"-connecting with others, becoming better community citizens, and, ultimately, making strategic business moves that are increasing revenue, awareness, and overall success in the marketplace-without the support of traditional mass media.\r\n\r\nEveryone is connected. Isn't it time for you and your company to connect to everyone? SIX PIXELS OF SEPARATION will show you how."}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-01-25T20:22:45.132781"}, "key": "/books/OL23148224M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6601263A"}], "publish_places": ["New York"], "pagination": "p. cm.", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:24:13.769223"}, "dewey_decimal_class": ["658.8/72"], "notes": "Includes index.", "identifiers": {"goodreads": ["6512479"], "librarything": ["8371705"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780446548236"], "lccn": ["2009002999"], "publish_date": "2009", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13759316W"}]}
