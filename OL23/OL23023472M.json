He is determined to know the truth about what he believes was her murder. He hires crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist, recently at the wrong end of a libel case, to get to the bottom of Harriet's disappearance. Lisbeth Salander, a twenty-four-year-old, pierced, tattooed genius hacker, possessed of the hard-earned wisdom of someone twice her age--and a terrifying capacity for ruthlessness--assists Blomkvist with the investigation. This unlikely team discovers a vein of nearly unfathomable iniquity running through the Vanger family, an astonishing corruption at the highest echelon of Swedish industrialism--and a surprising connection between themselves.--From publisher description."}, "genres": ["Fiction."], "source_records": ["marc:marc_loc_updates/v37.i05.records.utf8:14131523:1888", "marc:marc_loc_updates/v37.i04.records.utf8:9589535:1888", "marc:marc_loc_updates/v37.i10.records.utf8:14479894:2202", "ia:girlwithdragonta00lars_1"], "title": "The girl with the dragon tattoo", "work_titles": ["M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor."], "languages": [{"key": "/languages/eng"}], "subjects": ["Missing persons -- Sweden -- Fiction", "Rich people -- Sweden -- Fiction", "Corruption -- Sweden -- Fiction", "Sweden -- Fiction"], "publish_country": "nyu", "by_statement": "Stieg Larsson ; translated from the Swedish by Reg Keeland.", "type": {"key": "/type/edition"}, "revision": 10, "publishers": ["Random House Large Print"], "ia_box_id": ["IA179501"], "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-26T08:37:59.884317"}, "key": "/books/OL23023472M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL1414302A"}], "publish_places": ["New York"], "pagination": "793 p.
