The main finding of the paper is that, once the open economy aspect of the policy problem is considered, it is not optimal to smooth taxes following idiosyncratic shocks. Even when prices are flexible and inflation can costlessly act as a shock absorber to restore fiscal equilibrium, the presence of a terms of trade externality lead to movements in the tax rate. Also in contrast with the closed economy, the introduction of sticky prices can reduce the optimal volatility of taxes."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-31T17:46:17.827763"}, "key": "/books/OL23148629M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL1452648A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:28.556699"}, "lccn": ["2009376010"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"January 2009.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0905.pdf"], "publish_date": "2009", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL5889549W"}]}
