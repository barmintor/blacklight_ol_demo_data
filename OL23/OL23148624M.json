We show that a tariff on intermediate inputs can improve social welfare through mitigating hold-up problems. It does so if it discriminates in favor of the investing party, thereby improving its bargaining position. On the other hand, a tariff can prompt inefficient organizational choices if it discriminates in favor of less productive firms or if integration costs are low. Protection distorts organizational choices because tariff revenue, which is external to the firms, drives a wedge between the private and social gains to offshoring and integration."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-31T17:46:17.827763"}, "key": "/books/OL23148624M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL6601383A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:23.961613"}, "lccn": ["2009376005"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"December 2008.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0900.pdf"], "publish_date": "2008", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL13759444W"}]}
