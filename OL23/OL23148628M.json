After outlining the canonical core and periphery model, the paper examines the empirical evidence on three of its central predictions: the role of market access in determining factor prices, the related home market effect in which demand has a more than proportionate effect on production, and the potential existence of multiple equilibria. In reviewing the evidence, we highlight issues of measurement and identification, alternative potential explanations, and remaining areas for further research."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-29T22:44:04.493184"}, "key": "/books/OL23148628M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL1452556A"}], "publish_places": ["London"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-04-27T22:37:27.607370"}, "lccn": ["2009376009"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Title from PDF file (viewed on Jan. 23, 2009).\n\n\"January 2009.\"\n\nIncludes bibliographical references.\n\nAlso available in print.\n\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0904.pdf"], "publish_date": "2009", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL5888881W"}]}
