{"bio": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a major Genevois philosopher, writer, and composer of 18th-century Romanticism. His political philosophy influenced the French Revolution and the development of modern political, sociological and educational thought.\r\n\r\nHis novel, *Emile: or, On Education*, which he considered his most important work, is a seminal treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His sentimental novel, Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse, was of great importance to the development of pre-Romanticism and romanticism in fiction. Rousseau's autobiographical writings: his *Confessions*, which initiated the modern autobiography, and his *Reveries of a Solitary Walker* were among the pre-eminent examples of the late 18th-century movement known as the \"Age of Sensibility\", featuring an increasing focus on subjectivity and introspection that has characterized the modern age.\r\n\r\nRousseau also made important contributions to music as a theorist. During the period of the French Revolution, Rousseau was the most popular of the philosophers among members of the Jacobin Club. He was interred as a national hero in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death.<sup>[1][1]</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau"}, "name": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "death_date": "2 July 1778", "alternate_names": ["Rousseau", "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "Jean\u00adJacques Rousseau", "J.
