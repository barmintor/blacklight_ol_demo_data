{"bio": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "George Herbert Walker Bush (born June 12, 1924) was the 41st President of the United States (1989\u20131993). He was also Ronald Reagan's Vice President (1981\u20131989), a congressman, an ambassador, and Director of Central Intelligence.\r\n\r\nBush was born in Massachusetts to Senator and New York Banker Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor in 1941, at the age of 18, Bush postponed going to college and became the youngest aviator in the US Navy at the time. He served until the end of the war, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas and entered the oil business, becoming a millionaire by the age of 40.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Bush launched a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as president, defeating Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis. Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency; military operations were conducted in Panama and the Persian Gulf at a time of world change; the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union dissolved two years later. Domestically, Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise and after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of economic concerns, he lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton.\r\n\r\nBush is the father of George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, and Jeb Bush, former Governor of Florida. He is the last president to have been a World War II veteran.\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush"}, "name": "George Bush", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "personal_name": "Bush, George", "photos": [6387399], "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2010-05-10T20:58:20.853225"}, "latest_revision": 3, "key": "/authors/OL29239A", "birth_date": "12 June 1924", "type": {"key": "/type/author"}, "revision": 3}
