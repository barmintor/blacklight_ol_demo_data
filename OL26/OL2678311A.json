He moved to the University of Bonn in 1959, the University of M\u00fcnster in 1963, and the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1966, where he was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology. While he was at T\u00fcbingen he witnessed the student movements of the 1960s, which culminated in disturbances and riots in spring of 1968. Although he was seen as a dogmatic reformist, he believed that the radicalization of the student body was a result of a departure from traditional Catholic teachings.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Ratzinger was moved to the University of Regensburg in Bavaria. In 1972 he co-founded the theological journal Communio.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising.
