Includes material on peaceful uses of atomic energy, strategic use of atomic weapons, nuclear test ban, population control, problems of underdeveloped countries, reduction of Cold War tensions, the scientific community's role in diplomatic relations with allies, and the U.S. space program. Also reflected is Rabi's work at the Aberdeen Proving Ground and with Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Atomic Energy Commission, President's Science Advisory Committee, and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs.\n\nCorrespondents include Edouard Amaldi, Ruth Nanda Anshen, Hans Albrecht Bethe, Felix Bloch, Niels Bohr, Vannevar Bush, K.
