During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason."}, "name": "Mary Wollstonecraft", "links": [{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft", "type": {"key": "/type/link"}, "title": "Wikipedia (English)"}], "personal_name": "Mary Wollstonecraft", "death_date": "1797", "alternate_names": ["WOLLSTONECRAFT, MARY, 1759-1797.", "MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT", "Wollstonecraft Mary"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "photos": [6676870], "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2011-01-03T10:47:49.360419"}, "latest_revision": 5, "key": "/authors/OL73405A", "birth_date": "1759", "type": {"key": "/type/author"}, "revision": 5}
