What we find is that the stock of foreign students is an important predictor of subsequent migration. This holds true whether or not the lagged endogenous variable is included. The relationship is robust to the inclusion of time and country dummies, and remains when we account for outliers. The basic results also hold for a cross section of 36 countries of origin and 9 host countries. Our results have important policy implications which we discuss in the last section\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."}, "physical_format": "Electronic resource", "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-31T18:01:06.015960"}, "key": "/books/OL3477809M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL1453379A"}], "publish_places": ["Bonn, Germany"], "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-04-01T03:28:50.625462"}, "lccn": ["2005617585"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Also available in print.\nIncludes bibliographical references.\nTitle from PDF file as viewed on 6/14/2005.\nSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.\nMode of access: World Wide Web."}, "url": ["http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=1612"], "publish_date": "2005", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL5892539W"}]}
