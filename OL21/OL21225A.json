After a decade of abortive efforts to publish her stories, she had one of her romance novels accepted by Berkley Books for its Second Chance at Love imprint. The book was published as Hero at Large in 1987 under the pseudonym Steffie Hall. She subsequently churned out nearly a dozen similarly themed books before growing restive and turning an eye toward the adventure genre.
