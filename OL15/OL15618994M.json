He examines the collaborations of physicists and mechanicians aimed at standardizing beat and pitch and considers debates stirred by the standardization of aesthetic qualities. He describes the importance for scientists of choral societies as a vehicle for social life and cultural unity. Finally, he discusses a subject that occupied both physicists and musicians of the era: Could physicists, using the universal principles of mechanics, explain musical skill? Was the virtuosity of a Paganini or a Liszt somehow quantifiable? Jackson's historical consideration of questions at the intersection of music and physics shows us how each discipline helped shape the other.\"--BOOK JACKET"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2010-08-18T03:44:05.884263"}, "key": "/books/OL15618994M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL223014A"}], "publish_places": ["Cambridge, Mass"], "oclc_number": ["67392989"], "pagination": "x, 395 p. :", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-09-20T18:14:22.668196"}, "lccn": ["2006044991"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Includes bibliographic references (p.
