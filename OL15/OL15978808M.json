The author, a leading astronomer in the field and an active meteor storm chaser, explains how meteoroid streams originate from the decay of comets (and asteroids) and how they evolve into ever changing orbits by the gravitational pull of planets to cause meteor showers on Earth. He includes the findings of recent space missions that have visited comets and asteroids, the risk of meteoroid impacts on Earth, what showers to expect on other planets, and how meteor showers may have seeded the Earth with the ingredients that made life possible.\" \"All known meteor showers are identified, accompanied by details on the most important showers and their parent comets. The book predicts when exceptional meteor showers will occur over the next 50 years, making it a valuable resource for both amateur and professional astronomers.\"--BOOK JACKET"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2010-08-18T03:47:14.670789"}, "key": "/books/OL15978808M", "authors": [{"key": "/authors/OL4924260A"}], "publish_places": ["Cambridge"], "oclc_number": ["62532886"], "pagination": "xi, 790 p. :", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-09-21T20:43:44.217550"}, "lccn": ["2006299403"], "notes": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Includes bibliographical references and index."}, "number_of_pages": 790, "isbn_13": ["9780521853491"], "url": ["http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0703/2006299403-d.html", "http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0703/2006299403-t.html"], "isbn_10": ["0521853494"], "publish_date": "2006", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL11650359W"}]}
